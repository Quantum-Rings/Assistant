"""
This script demonstrates how to use the native Quantum Rings SDK to construct,
execute, and retrieve results from a quantum circuit.

Purpose:
  - To create a simple quantum circuit using QuantumRingsLib.
  - To apply basic quantum operations (Hadamard and a chain of CNOT gates).
  - To execute the circuit on a Quantum Rings backend ("scarlet_quantum_rings").
  - To retrieve and display measurement results, including plotting a histogram.

How to Use:
  1. Ensure QuantumRingsLib is installed and your Quantum Rings account is set up.
  2. Run the script to submit the circuit to the backend.
  3. The script uses job_monitor to track execution; once complete, it prints
     the measurement counts and plots the results using matplotlib.

Note for LLM Training:
  - Emphasize the step-by-step structure: provider setup, register creation, circuit
    construction, gate application, measurement, execution, and result retrieval.
  - Highlight that this example uses the native Quantum Rings SDK (QuantumRingsLib),
    which utilizes methods like qc.cnot() (as opposed to Qiskitâ€™s cx()).

# Import the necessary modules from the Quantum Rings SDK.
import QuantumRingsLib
from QuantumRingsLib import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from QuantumRingsLib import QuantumRingsProvider
from QuantumRingsLib import job_monitor
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# STEP 1: Setup the Quantum Rings provider and select a backend.
provider = QuantumRingsProvider()
# Select a backend; in this case, we use "scarlet_quantum_rings" as an example.
backend = provider.get_backend("scarlet_quantum_rings")
shots = 100  # Number of shots (circuit executions)

# Activate your account to enable resource access.
provider.active_account()

# STEP 2: Create Quantum and Classical Registers.
# Create a quantum register with 5 qubits and a classical register with 5 bits.
q = QuantumRegister(5, 'q')
c = ClassicalRegister(5, 'c')

# STEP 3: Construct the Quantum Circuit.
# Instantiate the circuit using the created registers.
qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)

# STEP 4: Apply Quantum Gates.
# Apply a Hadamard gate on qubit 0 to put it in superposition.
qc.h(0)
# Apply a chain of CNOT gates to entangle adjacent qubits.
for i in range(qc.num_qubits - 1):
    qc.cnot(i, i + 1)

# STEP 5: Add Measurements.
# Measure all qubits; this maps each qubit to its corresponding classical bit.
qc.measure_all()

# STEP 6: Execute the Circuit.
# Run the circuit on the selected backend with the specified number of shots.
job = backend.run(qc, shots)
# Monitor the job status using the provided job_monitor utility.
job_monitor(job)

# STEP 7: Retrieve and Display the Results.
# Get the results once the job is complete.
result = job.result()
# Extract the measurement counts from the result.
counts = result.get_counts()
print("Measurement Counts:", counts)

# (Optional) Plot the results using matplotlib.
plt.bar(counts.keys(), counts.values())
plt.xlabel("States")
plt.ylabel("Counts")
plt.title("Quantum Rings Circuit Results")
plt.show()
