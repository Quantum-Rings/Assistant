# LLM Assistant

## Documents
This folder contains documents used to train our LLM assistant to help with code development, debugging, and answering general questions about the Quantum Rings SDK.

There are 11 documents:
### General Documents
* Installation.md
* License.md
* Miscellaneous.md
* Pricing.md
* Qiskit-Topics.md

### SDK Functionality
* Summary-Python.md
* Summary-QuantumCircuit.md
* Summary-Integration.md

### Code Examples
* Convert-Qiskit-to-Quantum-Rings.md
* examples-QuantumRingsLib.md
* examples-quantumrings-toolkit-qiskit.md

## Contributing
You are invited to contribute to this community project. The documents will evolve over time as new versions of the SDK are released. If you discover something that is out of date or incorrect, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue directly.

## Error Messages
If you run into error messages while coding, it might indicate either a bug or that the LLM has not yet been trained to understand a particular feature. If you can resolve the issue and want to share, submit a code example.  If it looks like a bug, you can submit it with a pull request.

## Code Examples
The two "examples" files are generated from python scripts in the **Code** folder. They serve as minimal exemplary code samples that demonstrate the functionality of the SDK, rather than showcasing complete algorithms.

## Bugs
If you identify a bug and can replicate it, submit it to the **Bugs** folder and we'll take a look.
