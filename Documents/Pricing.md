FAQs
What’s included in the free academic plan?
The academic plan includes full simulation capabilities for up to 128 qubits, ideal for non-commercial research, and more than you should need to start learning.

How many qubits can I simulate?
Three factors will influence how many qubits you can simulate.

The Plan — The plan you sign up for will set the maximum allowed qubits.  These can be 64, 128, or with Enterprise you can unlock however many qubits you’d like.

Your Memory — The memory available in your system will influence how many qubits you can simulate on your machine

The Circuit Makeup — Not all operations are equal.  While we optimize how your circuits are stored and processed on your system, different operations have different levels of complexity.

If you are wondering about specific circuits,  the Quantum Rings team can make good faith estimates as to the compute resources required to simulate your circuit, but the best way to know is to try it out.

What if I’m a student and I want more qubits?
Generally speaking, Quantum Rings can make more qubits available to you for experimenting and testing.  Once signed up, on the Manage Keys page, you can request more qubits to be unlocked. After a review, you will be surprised that the Quantum Rings team is inclined to grant access to additional qubits if it’s for a good reason.

Can I share my account with my team?
No, Pricing for each plan is on a “named user” basis.  Each user must have their own plan— even for free tier plans.

Can I switch plans later?
Yes, you can upgrade or adjust your plan at any time to fit your evolving needs.

What support options are available?
Free Plans come with Community Support, while paid plans have a base support option of email support, and enterprise plans come with professional support 

Do you offer custom solutions for specific needs?
Absolutely. Our enterprise plan includes customized solutions tailored to your organization’s requirements, from advanced integrations to consulting and training.

How is billing handled for the professional plan?
The “personal and startup” plan can be billed monthly or annually using a credit card.  The Enterprise Plans are generally handled through invoicing directly with your finance organization.

Is there a trial period for paid plans?

Is the software compatible with my system?
Quantum Rings is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with your existing setup.
