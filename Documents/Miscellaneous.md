## Best Practices

Convert from Pennylane or Cirq or Q# to QuantumRings
Convert native code to QASM and then read the QASM into QuantumRings

Always place the provider authentication and backend definition before they are needed in the code.  
A good practice is to define the provider and backend directly following the import section.
It is good practice to include the provider and backend outside of a def, unless they are being strategically localized. 

# QuantumRingsLib 0.9.x vs 0.10.x
Use this guide to debug code based on the SDK version in use. If a user reports an error, ask them to run this version check and paste the result into chat:
```
from QuantumRingsLib import __version__
print("QuantumRingsLib version:", __version__)
```
## ‚úÖ What Works and What Fails
Positional shots in backend.run():

* In 0.9.x, calling backend.run(qc, 100) raises a TypeError.
* In 0.10.x, this positional form works.
* In both versions, using shots=100 always works and is safest.

Parameterized Circuits (Parameter, ParameterVector):
* Both versions define these classes, but they do not function properly.
* Any use of .assign_parameters(...) raises a binding error.
* You must use numeric constants directly when applying gates.

Example that works:
```
qc.rx(1.57, q[0])
```
Example that fails:
```
from QuantumRingsLib import Parameter
theta = Parameter("Œ∏")
qc.rx(theta, q[0])
qc.assign_parameters({theta: 1.57})  # ‚ùå breaks in both versions
```
assign_parameters(inplace=True):
* This also fails in both versions.
* There is no benefit to using inplace=True in the native SDK.
Classical Register Slicing:
* Expressions like c[:2] raise a TypeError.
* Only individual access works: c[0], c[1], etc.
job_monitor() and wait_for_final_state():
* These are stable in both versions.
* They provide blocking job monitoring and callbacks as expected.

# üîç Confirmed Change in 0.10.x
The only confirmed API improvement in 0.10.x is:
* Positional arguments in backend.run() now work
Everything else ‚Äî including parameter handling and classical register limitations ‚Äî remains unchanged.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid (LLM Guidance)
* Do not assume Qiskit‚Äôs assign_parameters() or bind_parameters() work in the native SDK
* If you see a pybind11 casting error, it‚Äôs likely related to parameter usage
* If a user gets a TypeError from backend.run(qc, 100), they are using 0.9.x
* Always use shots=... syntax for version-safe code

# üß™ Additional Tests (For Future Enhancements)
If needed, consider testing:
* Chained use of parameters across multiple gates
* Assigning parameters during construction instead of post hoc
* Passing parameter values in batch-mode estimators
* Appending parameterized sub-circuits
These are not critical for day-to-day debugging but could matter in advanced workflows.
