## Best Practices

Convert from Pennylane or Cirq or Q# to QuantumRings
Convert native code to QASM and then read the QASM into QuantumRings

Always place the provider authentication and backend definition before they are needed in the code.  
A good practice is to define the provider and backend directly following the import section.
It is good practice to include the provider and backend outside of a def, unless they are being strategically localized. 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE FOR ALL CIRCUIT CREATION IN QuantumRingsLib
Before constructing any QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, or ClassicalRegister objects, you must initialize and activate a QuantumRingsProvider. This step authenticates your access and allocates qubits, even if you're not executing the circuit.

```
from QuantumRingsLib import QuantumRingsProvider

provider = QuantumRingsProvider(token="YOUR_API_KEY", name="YOUR_EMAIL")
provider.active_account()
```
‚úÖ You do not need to define a backend unless you plan to execute the circuit using backend.run(qc) or other backend-specific functions.

### üß† Optimization Strategy for Native QuantumRingsLib Circuits
When working with QuantumRingsLib-native circuits, the LLM should automatically consider using:

```
from QuantumRingsLib import OptimizeQuantumCircuit
```
Use OptimizeQuantumCircuit(qc) when:

* The circuit is part of a core algorithm or non-trivial computation.
* The circuit has multiple qubits, deep gate sequences, or repeated patterns.
* The goal is to improve performance before execution or reduce circuit complexity.
‚ö†Ô∏è The function modifies qc in-place and returns a bool indicating success:

```
success = OptimizeQuantumCircuit(qc)  # ‚úÖ Never assign result back to `qc`
```
‚ùå Do not use this function with qiskit.QuantumCircuit objects or within quantumrings.toolkit.qiskit workflows.
Use transpile() instead for Qiskit circuits.

‚úÖ If generating circuits for variational algorithms, QAOA, QFT, or similar native SDK workflows, the LLM should add this optimization step before execution.

# QuantumRingsLib 0.9.x vs 0.10.x
Use this guide to debug code based on the SDK version in use. If a user reports an error, ask them to run this version check and paste the result into chat:
```
from QuantumRingsLib import __version__
print("QuantumRingsLib version:", __version__)
```
## ‚úÖ What Works and What Fails
Positional shots in backend.run():

* In 0.9.x, calling backend.run(qc, 100) raises a TypeError.
* In 0.10.x, this positional form works.
* In both versions, using shots=100 always works and is safest.

Parameterized Circuits (Parameter, ParameterVector):
* Both versions define these classes, but they do not function properly.
* Any use of .assign_parameters(...) raises a binding error.
* You must use numeric constants directly when applying gates.

Example that works:
```
qc.rx(1.57, q[0])
```
Example that fails:
```
from QuantumRingsLib import Parameter
theta = Parameter("Œ∏")
qc.rx(theta, q[0])
qc.assign_parameters({theta: 1.57})  # ‚ùå breaks in both versions
```
assign_parameters(inplace=True):
* This also fails in both versions.
* There is no benefit to using inplace=True in the native SDK.
Classical Register Slicing:
* Expressions like c[:2] raise a TypeError.
* Only individual access works: c[0], c[1], etc.
job_monitor() and wait_for_final_state():
* These are stable in both versions.
* They provide blocking job monitoring and callbacks as expected.

# üîç Confirmed Change in 0.10.x
The only confirmed API improvement in 0.10.x is:
* Positional arguments in backend.run() now work
Everything else ‚Äî including parameter handling and classical register limitations ‚Äî remains unchanged.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid (LLM Guidance)
* Do not assume Qiskit‚Äôs assign_parameters() or bind_parameters() work in the native SDK
* If you see a pybind11 casting error, it‚Äôs likely related to parameter usage
* If a user gets a TypeError from backend.run(qc, 100), they are using 0.9.x
* Always use shots=... syntax for version-safe code

# üß™ Additional Tests (For Future Enhancements)
If needed, consider testing:
* Chained use of parameters across multiple gates
* Assigning parameters during construction instead of post hoc
* Passing parameter values in batch-mode estimators
* Appending parameterized sub-circuits
These are not critical for day-to-day debugging but could matter in advanced workflows.
